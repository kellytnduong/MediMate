# MediMate
MediMate was prototyped with all senior and cognitively impaired prescription intakers in mind. Using an STM32 and a breadboard of wires, finicky photoresistors and other various hardware components - we created the start of a prescription dispensing assistant! Take a look at our Design Document for 19 pages of details :)
